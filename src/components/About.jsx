      <p className="ml-5 text-[#c0c4d4] mt-2 mr-5">
        I'm Boris â€” a curious soul who spent over a decade in the transport business, 
        mastering logistics, planning, and team coordination. But deep down, Iâ€™ve always 
        been drawn to the world of computers. So I finally made the jump and followed my passion.  
      </p>
      <p className="ml-5 text-[#c0c4d4] mt-2 mr-5">
        Now Iâ€™m fully focused on becoming a great frontend developer. I love working with 
        HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and React â€” building clean and simple interfaces is my kind of fun.  
        I enjoy learning new things every day, whether itâ€™s diving into JavaScript quirks 
        or figuring out how to fix a mysterious layout bug at midnight.
      </p>
      <p className="ml-5 text-[#c0c4d4] mt-2 mr-5">
        Iâ€™m not just a coder, though. I bring years of real-world experience in communication, 
        problem-*creating* (ðŸ˜„), and seeing things through from start to finish. I also enjoy 
        tweaking my Linux machine, staying healthy, and having the occasional Czech pilsner.
